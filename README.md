## Abstract

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor known for its ability to infiltrate and colonize normal brain tissue. Despite the clinical relevance of this behavior, the molecular underpinnings of infiltrating GBM cells in the peritumoral zone remain unexplored in patients. Here, we show that peritumoral progenitor-like GBM cells activate transcriptional programs associated with increased invasivity, synaptic activity, and NOTCH signaling. These cells spatially colocalize with neurons and exhibit increased propensity for neuronal crosstalk. The epigenetic encoding of these infiltrative cells mirrors that of uncommitted OPCs in the developing human brain, a neurodevelopmental state marked by increased synaptic and migratory potential. Functional perturbation of a nominated regulatory factor, ZEB1, confirmed its role in maintaining the invasive and uncommitted developmental potential of infiltrative GBM cells. Our findings provide insights into the neurodevelopmental hijacking that drives GBM infiltration in patients, rationalizing further investigation into targeting differentiation potential as a therapeutic strategy.
